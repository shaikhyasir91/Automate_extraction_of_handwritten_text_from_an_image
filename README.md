# Automate_extraction_of_handwritten_text_from_an_image
This project aims to extract handwritten text from images using a deep learning model. The dataset used for training and validation is the IAM Handwriting Database. The model architecture includes convolutional layers followed by bidirectional LSTM layers and uses the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function.
