# Automate_extraction_of_handwritten_text_from_an_image

Handwritten text recognition is an essential component of various applications, such as digitizing historical documents, automated form processing, and assisting visually impaired individuals with text-to-speech conversions. This project focuses on developing an advanced deep learning model to automate the extraction of handwritten text from images.

Leveraging the IAM Handwriting Database, we implemented a model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers for capturing sequential dependencies in the text. The model is trained and evaluated using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function, which is well-suited for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks where alignment between input and output sequences is unknown.

Our approach demonstrates the potential of deep learning in overcoming the challenges posed by handwritten text recognition, paving the way for improved accuracy and efficiency in processing handwritten documents.
